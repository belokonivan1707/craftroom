DRY - Do not repeat yourself
KISS - Keep it simple, smart
SOLID: 
* Single-responsibility Principle
* The open-closed principle says code should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* The Liskov substitution principle states that any class should be substitutable for its parent class without unexpected consequences.
What it really means is that if you pass a subclass of an abstraction you need to make sure you donâ€™t alter any behavior or state semantics of the parent abstraction.
