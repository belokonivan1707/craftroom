1. What is a closure? 
Closure, it's a combination of functions and a lexical environment from which it was declared 
Closures allow functions to access variables from the  enclosing  scope or environment even after it 
leaves the scope in which it was declared. 


2. Arrow fucntions and this? 
With arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

When you use the arrow function inside the object, it inherits the this value from the enclosing lexical scope
